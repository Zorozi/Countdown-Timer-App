# Countdown Timer

This is a simple web application that shows the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until a specific date. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the countdown timer, simply enter the date  that you are counting down to in the input field provided. The format should be in "dd/mm/yyyy" (for example, "31/12/2023").

Once you have entered the desired date, click the "Enter" button to begin the countdown. The remaining time will be displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Customization

If you would like to customize the look and feel of the countdown timer, you can do so by modifying the CSS code in the `style.css` file.
